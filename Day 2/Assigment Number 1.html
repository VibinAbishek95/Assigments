            // console.log(1 + "2" + "2"). Result will be 122 because as + acts as a concatenation operator.
            console.log(1 + "2" + "2");

            // console.log(1 + +"2" + "2" ). Result will be 32 because + or - operand in front of a string converts it in to number variable. 
            // so here +"2" will become 2 hence the result will be 32.
            console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");

            // console.log(1 + -"1" + "2"). The result is 02 because + or - operand in front of a string converts it in to number variable. 
            // so here -"1" will become -1 hence the result will be 02.
            console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");

            // console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2") results in 112 because + acts as a concatenation operator.
            // First "1" is converted into numeric type and concatenat with "1" and "2"
            console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");

            // console.log("A" - "B" + "2") the - operator can not be applied to strings, 
            // and since neither "A" nor "B" can be converted to numeric values, 
            // "A" - "B" yields NaN which is then concatenated with the string "2" to yield “NaN2”.
            console.log( "A" - "B" + "2");

            // console.log("A" - "B" + 2) like the previous one, "A" - "B" yields NaN. 
            // But any operator applied to NaN with any other numeric operand will still yield NaN.
            console.log( "A" - "B" + 2);
